Installation instructions for SNAF.

Required software:
* Web server with PHP 4 or newer.
* A MySQL server.

SNAF is mainly developed on Linux, but should work on other platforms as well.
You can install SNAF in some different ways, to state some:
* Installing a stable release
* Installing a nightly build
* Checking out a recent revision using Subversion

To use nice URLs in SNAF you must use Apache with the module mod_rewrite and
apply a <Directory> statement.
Below is an example of such a statement, change paths to your need.
<Directory /www/snaf>
	RewriteEngine On
	#The path below should point to the dirname of the url, e.g. /snaf for http://yourserver.com/snaf
	RewriteBase /snaf
	RewriteRule ^login$ index.php
	RewriteRule ^logout$ index.php
	RewriteRule ^forum:([0-9]+)$ index.php?location=forum&locationid=$1
	RewriteRule ^thread:([0-9]+)$ index.php?location=thread&locationid=$1
	RewriteRule ^user:([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)$ index.php?location=user&locationid='$1'
	RewriteRule ^search$ index.php?location=search&locationid=null
	RewriteRule ^search:([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$ index.php?location=search&locationid='$1'
</Directory>

You will also need to create a MySQL database like this:
CREATE DATABASE snaf;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON snaf.* TO snaf@localhost;

Remember, freedom is nice...
