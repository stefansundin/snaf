Description:
This file handles the session, i.e. it declares a $user variable which other
scripts can refer to to get a users username, permissions and other details
(like email and such).
The choice of $user instead of $_SESSION was decided because even users who
hasn't loggedin should be able to have their permissions and set options.
If a session cookie is detected this script checks if the session is valid,
if it is and contains an user_id, the script queries the database for user
details, which it then puts in $user.
If the user however isn't loggedin, the script put default values into $user.
